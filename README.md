# indoor-map-ar
Indoor mapping and augmented reality POC

Dependencies:

- Mapbox Unity SDK (1.2)
- AR library (https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-arkit-unity)
- Vuforia token?


-----------
**Context:** We've had significant interest (>5 asks) at [Unite Austin](https://github.com/mapbox/unity/issues/239#issuecomment-337327306) and VRDC as well as through sales (yesterday [Smartify](https://github.com/mapbox/unity/issues/270https://github.com/mapbox/unity/issues/270) for example)  whether we support indoor maps. Indoor maps are a critical component of AR experiences and a developing use case (see American Airlines' latest AR app publicity as an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zohRwHzu9gA). They also fit into Mapbox's product vision as a mapping and geodata as a service provider. 

**Problem:** We currently don't support indoor maps. But this is a potential new data type for Mapbox that is an extension of our existing 3D building data and maps. It's also a potential source of new BD Leads into Mapbox. 

**Solution:**  We'd like to create an Indoor Map AR Demo to 1) showcase a new use case, 2) be able to say "yes" to supporting indoor maps, 3) potentially create a new data type for Mapbox, and 4) potentially use this as an opportunity to collaborate. @peterqliu has created an indoor map of the Mapbox that we can use as a starting point. This is a Q4 priority.
